              The breeze of wind had always accompanied me everyday, the smell
              of sea and the never-ending horizon guided the way. They came to
              me for a greeting, something that would always be there smiling.
              Like glittering of sand, soft and warmed by the sun, the emotions
              that last and will forever stand. The stars had spoken to me
              through the ocean, they asked me in return to write them stories
              and put them into motion. Tales that could reach even the deepest
              of the heart, words that would not be less than an art. Playing
              like a symphony, dancing as if a memory, to bring something that
              is happy. So, I decided to create these tales to tell you, one day
              you might have the same dream as I do. A shallow light upon the
              sea, hollow but colorful for the eyes to see, started to row my
              soul to where it should be.

              I have been working on an original fantasy novel for quite awhile
              now, however I have yet to find a publisher. The whole plot have
              yet to be finished, I wish to revise this so it would be very fun
              for people to enjoy. <br /><br />
              The story takes place in a future world where the sea becomes a
              deadly place due to the changing nature of earth and the damage
              humanity has done. Half of the population in the sea was lost, it
              became a place not kind to men. After moving away to a place where
              the sky still lit the ocean while following her father's work. She
              was reminded of the beauty the sea once held. Near the shore
              laughing happily, a stupid looking young boy row the his tiny boat
              away to the deadly sea. A young sailor boy with dreams to meet the
              whale.
